How might the window’s apparent normality influence your detection strategy?",
      "answer": "A. The time series window from steps 13 to 36 displays a smooth, consistent upward trend in current_value, closely mirroring the normal_value at each step. There are no abrupt spikes, drops, or irregular deviations; the increase is gradual and aligns with expected normal behavior. The proximity to window boundaries does not reveal any transition anomalies or edge effects. This strong pattern consistency suggests a highly stable segment, which may require more sensitive or context-aware detection strategies to identify only the most subtle anomalies. However, in this window, there is no evidence of subtle anomalies, and the apparent normality supports confidence in the underlying process stability.",

      "answer": "A. The short, continuous downward spike at the start of the window (steps 115–119: 0.34, 0.37, 0.40, 0.39, 0.41 vs. normal 0.54–0.67) is a clear anomaly, as current_values are significantly below normal_values, with deviations up to ~0.23. This sharp drop, followed by a rapid return to normal, is not consistent with typical random fluctuations or noise, especially given its amplitude and duration (2–3 steps). The rest of the window stabilizes, with current_values aligning closely with normal_values, suggesting the anomaly is localized and not part of a broader trend. Such a pattern indicates a transient, non-random event, likely requiring further investigation rather than being attributed to normal variation.",
