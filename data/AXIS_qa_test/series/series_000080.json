      "answer": "A) The sharp increase is a genuine anomaly because the time series shows a prolonged period of stable, low values (-1.49, then -0.04) before a sudden, isolated spike to 2.95 and 1.22, after which values immediately return to the previous baseline (-0.04). This abrupt deviation—without any gradual buildup or subsequent similar fluctuations—indicates an irregular, non-recurring event rather than a natural fluctuation. The lack of comparable spikes in the surrounding data further supports the conclusion that this is a local upward spike anomaly, significantly impacting the overall pattern by breaking the established stability.",

      "question": "Given that the window from step 6 to 21 appears normal, what types of evidence or statistical characteristics would you look for within this segment to either support or refute the presence of subtle anomalies, considering the influence of window boundaries on anomaly detection?",
      "answer": "A. To support or refute subtle anomalies in this window, I would examine for small but consistent deviations from normal_value, such as gradual drifts, minor spikes, or increased variability. The pattern shows a stable sequence near -0.04 for several steps, followed by a sudden shift to around 1.08, which aligns closely with the normal_value of 1.46. No irregularities, spikes, or trends beyond expected variation are present. The abrupt level shift matches the normal pattern, suggesting a regime change rather than an anomaly. Window boundaries can sometimes mask or exaggerate such transitions, but here, the data remains consistent with expected behavior, supporting the absence of subtle anomalies.",
