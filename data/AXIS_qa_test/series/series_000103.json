      "answer": "A) The window displays consistent, expected behavior with no evidence of anomalies.  \nExplanation: The current_value data in steps 86-119 fluctuates within a typical range, exhibiting minor ups and downs but no abrupt spikes, sustained trends, or irregular deviations. Values alternate between positive and negative, reflecting normal variability rather than any persistent drift or sharp outlier. This stable pattern aligns with the global context stating \"No anomalies detected,\" confirming that the window maintains expected behavior without any indication of anomalous events.",

      "answer": "C) A sudden upward spike immediately succeeded by a sustained upward drift\n\nExplanation: The time series shows a pronounced anomaly near the center: at step 54, the current_value jumps sharply from 0.21 to 3.00 (spike amplitude 5.56), which is a significant deviation from the normal_value (-0.44). This is immediately followed by another elevated value (2.52), before gradually returning toward baseline. This pattern—a sudden, large upward spike followed by a period of elevated values—matches option C. Such behavior is characteristic of a local spike anomaly with a subsequent increase, indicating a significant and unusual event in the data. This anomaly disrupts the otherwise oscillatory, near-baseline pattern seen in the rest of the window.",
