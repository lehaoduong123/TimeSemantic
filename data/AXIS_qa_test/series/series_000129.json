      "answer": "B) The window is unlikely to contain anomalies, as both the start and end exhibit consistent patterns typical of normal behavior.  \nExplanation: The current_value data shows two stable regionsâ€”initial low values (around 1.00), followed by a sustained higher plateau (around 2.20), and then a return to the initial lower range. There are no abrupt spikes, irregular fluctuations, or deviations from expected values. The transitions between regimes are smooth and align with the normal_value reference. This pattern indicates stable, expected behavior throughout the window, supporting the conclusion that no anomalies are present.",

The current values closely match the normal values at each step, and the series exhibits expected fluctuations, including a gradual increase, a dip, and subsequent higher values. These variations are consistent with normal behavior, and no unexpected spikes, abrupt drops, or irregularities are present. The pattern remains within typical bounds, supporting the absence of anomalies during this window.",
