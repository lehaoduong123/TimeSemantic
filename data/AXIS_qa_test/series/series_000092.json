      "answer": "A. The section from step 71 to 100 displays clear evidence of anomalous behavior, specifically a local continuous upward spike anomaly. This is observed as five consecutive sharp increases in current_value at steps 79, 81, 85, 89, and 93 (values: -0.38, -0.35, -0.15, -0.35, -0.35), significantly deviating from the smoother, gradual decline seen elsewhere in the window. These spikes are abrupt and stand out against the otherwise negative trend, with amplitudes far exceeding the normal fluctuations, indicating a substantial and unusual disruption in the time series. Such a pattern is characteristic of a local anomaly, suggesting a temporary but pronounced deviation from expected behavior, which could signal underlying issues or events affecting the data during this interval.",

      "question": "True or False: The absence of irregular fluctuations between steps 6 and 26 suggests that no anomalies are present within this window.",
      "answer": "True. The time series window from steps 6 to 26 shows a smooth, gradual decline in current_value without any abrupt spikes, sharp drops, or irregular fluctuations. Each step transitions consistently to the next, and current_values closely follow the normal_value trend. This steady downward trend and the absence of unexpected deviations indicate stable behavior, supporting the conclusion that no anomalies are present in this window. The regularity and alignment with normal values further reinforce the absence of abnormal events or outliers.",
