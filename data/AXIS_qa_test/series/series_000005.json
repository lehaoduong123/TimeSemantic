      "question": "How would you evaluate whether there are subtle anomalies present within the window from step 39 to 70, and what types of evidence would you seek to determine if the apparent normality is masking any unusual patterns or behaviors?",
      "answer": "A. The time series window from steps 39 to 70 displays a smooth, continuous trend without abrupt spikes, irregularities, or deviations from the expected pattern. The values decrease steadily from -1.54 to around -2.88, then gradually increase back to positive values up to 0.94. This V-shaped pattern suggests a typical cyclical behavior rather than any hidden anomalies. To evaluate for subtle anomalies, one would look for sudden jumps, outlier points, or irregular fluctuations that break the smooth progression; none are present here. The consistency and symmetry of the changes reinforce the absence of unusual patterns, indicating that the apparent normality is genuine and not masking subtle anomalies.",

      "answer": "D) The window exhibits consistent, expected behavior with no significant deviation from the established pattern. The current_value data from steps 41 to 63 shows a smooth, gradual upward trend, moving from more negative to less negative values without any sharp spikes, abrupt drops, or irregular fluctuations. Each value closely follows the previous one, and there are no points that stand out as outliers or structural breaks. This consistent progression and lack of anomalies indicate the time series is behaving normally within this window, reflecting stable underlying dynamics.",
