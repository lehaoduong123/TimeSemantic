      "answer": "D) An abrupt, sharp local drop immediately followed by a slow, steady recovery, deviating from expected behavior.\n\nAnalysis: The time series shows a pronounced, rapid decline at the start (from -0.27 to 0.46 within a few steps), representing a sharp drop. This is followed by a gradual, steady rise back toward and above the previous levels, evident in the slow increase from 0.46 up to around 0.75 by step 32. This pattern is atypical for normal fluctuations or seasonal variations and indicates a local anomaly characterized by a sudden drop and slow recovery, as supported by the noted decline amplitude of 2.21. This anomaly could signal an unusual event or disruption within the system, warranting further investigation.",

      "question": "When analyzing the time series window from step 46 to 63, which scenario best describes the expected detection outcome if an anomaly occurs immediately after the window ends?\n\nA) The window would show early warning patterns, such as subtle irregularities, indicating a forthcoming anomaly.  \nB) The anomaly would likely be misattributed to this window due to its proximity to the window's boundary.  \nC) The aggregate statistics within the window would be distorted, making the entire window appear anomalous.  \nD) The window would appear normal, with no indication of an anomaly, as the anomaly lies outside the window range.",
      "answer": "D) The window would appear normal, with no indication of an anomaly, as the anomaly lies outside the window range.  \nExplanation: The time series window from step 46 to 63 shows a smooth, consistent downward trend in current_value, with each value matching its normal_value exactly. There are no spikes, irregularities, or deviations within this windowâ€”no early warning signs or statistical distortions. Since no anomalies are detected in this window and the anomaly occurs only after the window ends, this window remains unaffected and would be classified as normal based on the observed data.",
