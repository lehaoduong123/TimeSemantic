      "answer": "True. The time series from steps 3 to 30 shows a sudden sharp increase (a spike) in current_value, followed by a partial decrease rather than stabilization at a new level. This pattern is characteristic of a local spike anomaly, as opposed to a regime shift or transition to a new stable baseline. The abrupt rise and subsequent partial drop indicate a transient, irregular event rather than a sustained change, which is further supported by the anomaly description noting a \"local sudden increase\" and \"upward spike anomaly.\" Such anomalies can significantly distort short-term analysis or forecasting if not accounted for.",

      "answer": "D) The window displays multiple abrupt upward deviations, including sharp local increases, wide sustained spikes, and sudden isolated rises, all confined within but not exceeding the window boundaries. The current_value data reveals sharp upward movements (e.g., sudden increases and spikes) that deviate strongly from the smoother normal_value trend. Notably, there are significant anomalies: a local sudden increase (sharp rise followed by partial decrease), a wide upward spike (sustained high amplitude), and an isolated upward spike (sharp rise to a peak). These anomalies disrupt the normal trend, indicating irregular, non-random events rather than gradual or stable fluctuations. The anomalies are contained within the window, highlighting their local and impactful nature on the overall time series behavior in this segment.",
