      "answer": "C. The time series window from step 26 to 52 shows all current_values consistently at or extremely close to zero, with no visible spikes, trends, or irregular deviations. Both positive and negative zeros are present, but these are numerically identical and indicate no real fluctuation. To conclude an anomaly is present, one would look for abrupt changes, sustained deviations from the normal_value, or outliersâ€”none of which are observed here. Subtle anomalies would manifest as small but consistent departures from zero, which are absent. This pattern signifies a stable, non-volatile segment, supporting the conclusion that no anomalies are present and all fluctuations are within normal, expected ranges.",

      "question": "Given that the window from step 2 to 31 appears normal, what evidence would you look for to determine if there are any subtle or hidden anomalies within this segment, particularly considering how anomalies may manifest near the window's boundaries?",
      "answer": "A. I would look for subtle irregularities such as small but consistent deviations from zero, abrupt changes between consecutive values, or micro-trends at the start or end of the window that differ from the overall flat pattern. In this segment, all current_values are essentially zero, with no visible spikes, trends, or irregularities, and every value closely matches its normal_value. This uniformity indicates a stable and non-anomalous pattern, suggesting no hidden anomalies within or near the boundaries. Such consistency is significant, as even minor deviations could signal early, subtle anomalies, but none are present here.",
