The current_value data displays a generally downward trend, with values gradually decreasing and occasional minor fluctuations. While there are some sharper drops (e.g., from 0.14 to -0.61 and from -1.05 to -2.05), these changes appear consistent with the overall declining trend and do not represent irregular spikes or outliers. The pattern remains smooth without sudden, isolated deviations, supporting the conclusion that no anomalies are present in this segment.",

      "answer": "D) The window maintains steady and consistent values without unusual deviations, supporting the absence of detectable anomalies.  \nExplanation: The current_value data shows a smooth progression: an initial dip, a steady rise to a peak, and a gradual decline, all without abrupt spikes, drops, or erratic fluctuations. The values closely track the normal_value baseline, with no significant deviations or irregularities. This pattern indicates stable system behavior and aligns with the provided context that no anomalies were detected, confirming the time series is behaving as expected in this window.",
