      "answer": "B) The window is expected to demonstrate continuous normal behavior with no detectable anomalies.  \nExplanation: The current_value data shows a smooth, consistent upward trend from -0.97 to 0.27, with each step incrementing by a similar amount and no sudden spikes, drops, or irregularities. This gradual increase aligns closely with the normal_value at each step, indicating stability and the absence of deviations or abrupt changes. The lack of any detected anomalies further supports that the pattern within this window is typical and expected for the time series, signifying healthy, predictable behavior.",

      "answer": "False. The pattern within steps 34 to 62 is not consistent with normal variability. The data shows a local slow decline, reaching a minimum, followed by a rapid riseâ€”an anomaly characterized by a decline amplitude of 0.53. The initial values decrease gradually from -2.35 to approximately -2.88, then reverse direction and increase rapidly towards -0.18. This sequence deviates from typical fluctuations, indicating a significant local anomaly rather than routine variation. Such a pattern may reflect a transient event or structural change in the underlying process, impacting the overall time series behavior.",
