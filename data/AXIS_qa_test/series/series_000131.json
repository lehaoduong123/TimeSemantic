There are no sudden spikes, irregular fluctuations, or deviations outside these ranges. The transitions between regimes are abrupt but consistent with normal regime shifts, not anomalies. All values align closely with their normal counterparts, and the absence of outliers or erratic behavior confirms no evidence of abnormal fluctuations or anomalous patterns within this window.",

      "answer": "B) An isolated, abrupt upward deviation forming a distinct spike that returns quickly to baseline, located away from the window edges.\n\nExplanation: The time series window shows a clear local upward spike anomaly, with values jumping sharply from around 2.92–2.95 down to -1.84, then fluctuating near -1.8 to -1.9, followed by a sudden, brief rise to positive values (1.01–1.10) before returning to the baseline. This pattern is not consistent with gradual trends, oscillations, or sustained plateaus. Instead, it represents a distinct, isolated spike—an abrupt deviation from the normal range—indicative of a transient anomaly. This spike stands out from the otherwise stable or oscillating values, highlighting its significance as a local, non-recurring event.",
